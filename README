Description:
The logical toolkit ICHARATE [1] is built upon a formalization of
multimodal categorial grammars [2] in Coq proof assistant.
This toolkit aims at facilitating the study of these
complicated formalisms by allowing users to build interactively the
syntactic derivations of different sentences, compute their
semantic interpretations and also prove universal properties of entire
classes of grammars using a collection of already established derived
rules. Several tactics are defined to ease the interaction with users.

Keywords : Multimodal Categorial Grammars, Syntax/Semantics Interface,
Higher Order Logic, Meta-Linguistics, Coq Proof Assistant

Contents:
Lib: auxiliary files containing some properties about lists.

Kernel: contains the deep embedding of the syntax and semantics of
Multimodal Categorial Grammars in Coq. Two logical presentations are
formalized namely sequent calculus and natural deduction.

Tacs: tactics defined using Ltac language.

Meta: meta properties and generic derived rules in multimodal logic.

Examples: some examples which use concrete linguistic data.
